# static-website-generator

This is next project to generate static website with template.
I found many people want to have simple informational website. Wordpress is good starting point but people are struggle to use it as it's interface not familiar to normal people.
This website generator is focused on making blog-ish UI to generate static website.


## Plan

First, Implement basic portfolio site with Dynamic switchable component with given parameters. All the sited info is stored in JSON equivalent template file.
Second, Implement Each component have creatable mode to generate a template JSON.
Third, Implement Component to be stored in DB and Dynamic component load it with uuid to render.

# Project overview

## API-Board

#### Idea

  When I first experienced programming and a kanban system, I found lack of communication flows between different roles. e.g between designers and programmers.
  A Kanban system is good to communicate between who shares background but not for collaborate with different backgrounds.
  This is why I start to develop a solution.

   - First: Team should communicate with common entities. Originally, I thought UI pages.
   - Kanban should be based on what a team makes. Originally, I thought API. UI pages contain APIs. So I thought API is atomic base.

  Currently, I think it should be named as `Entity-Board`. How we programming is based on entities And all team members should share the concept of entities for the business.

#### Goal
  Creating communication tool for teams with different roles. So teams could communicate clearly without much verbal communication.
  0. Transparent communication tool
  2. High performance communication across roles.
  3. Manager can see whole process and progress with an overview. So they can easily find bottlenecks.
  4. Able to estimate the estimation skills of manager and help mangers and lead to improve estimation skills.
     1. Able to show risks on estimation
     2. Able to estimate performance of people.

# Project overview

## API-Board

#### Idea

  When I first experienced programming and a kanban system, I found lack of communication flows between different roles. e.g between designers and programmers.
  A Kanban system is good to communicate between who shares background but not for collaborate with different backgrounds.
  This is why I start to develop a solution.

   - First: Team should communicate with common entities. Originally, I thought UI pages.
   - Kanban should be based on what a team makes. Originally, I thought API. UI pages contain APIs. So I thought API is atomic base.

  Currently, I think it should be named as `Entity-Board`. How we programming is based on entities And all team members should share the concept of entities for the business.

#### Goal
  Creating communication tool for teams with different roles. So teams could communicate clearly without much verbal communication.
  1. Transparent communication tool
  2. High performance communication across roles.
  3. Manager can see whole process and progress with an overview. So they can easily find bottlenecks.
  4. Able to estimate the estimation skills of manager and help mangers and lead to improve estimation skills.
     1. Able to show risks on estimation
     2. Able to estimate performance of people.


## static generator

#### Idea

  I found many people want to have simple informational website. Wordpress is good starting point but people are struggle to use it as it's interface not familiar to normal people.
  This website generator is focused on making blog-ish UI to generate static website.

#### Gaol

  2. Can fill out content in templates


## Lang learning with reading

#### Idea
  I am interested in learning languages and believe reading and speaking is important.
  Only with speaking, language skills are growing not so fast.
  Only with reading, people wouldn't have high speaking and listening skills.

  This project has been inspired by DuChinese app.

     1. could make words to show definition between two different languages
     2. could recod each phrase.
  2. User can read dialogue in selected language
     1. able to see translated dialogue in selected language
     2. able to listen audion in selected language
     3. able to click word to see definition
  3. words from read dialogues will be shown in vocabulary to memorize.
     1. able to mark memorize or not mutiple times
     2. If it is not memorize at the round. It will show more often
     3. memorized word will shown regularly
